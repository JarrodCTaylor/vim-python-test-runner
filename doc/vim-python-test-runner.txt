1. Intro                                                    *test-runner-intro*

A simple way of running tests for your python files from within VIM.

This plugin was created to allow running Django tests with django-nose that
require database interaction from within Vim. Thus avoiding the need to toggle
between your vim session and the shell for longer periods of time. It will
also run your regular python unit tests with nosetests as well when not
working on a Django project.

===============================================================================
2. Requirements                                      *test-runner-requirements*

You need a VIM version that was compiled with python support, which is typical
for most distributions on Linux/Mac.  You can check this by running
``vim --version | grep +python``
if you get a hit you are in business.

Tests are ran with either django-nose or nosetest so these will need to be
pip installed in order for the plugin to function properly.

===============================================================================
3. Usage                                                    *test-runner-usage*

The plugin provides nine commands:

- `DjangoTestApp`: Run all tests for the current app
- `DjangoTestFile`: Run all tests in the current file
- `DjangoTestClass`: Run all tests in the current class
- `DjangoTestMethod`: Run test for the current method
- `NosetestFile`: Run all tests for the current file
- `NosetestClass`: Run all tests in the current class
- `NosetestMethod`: Run the current test method (inside of a class)
- `NosetestBaseMethod`: Run the current test method (outside of a class)
- `RerunLastTests`: Rerun the last tests

All arguments can be tab-completed. Ensure that your cursor is within a
file, class or method as appropriate for the command being called.

For ease of usage you can map the above actions to a shortcut. For example,
if you wanted leader mappings you could set something like the following in
your vimrc:

    nnoremap<Leader>da :DjangoTestApp<CR>
    nnoremap<Leader>df :DjangoTestFile<CR>
    nnoremap<Leader>dc :DjangoTestClass<CR>
    nnoremap<Leader>dm :DjangoTestMethod<CR>
    nnoremap<Leader>nf :NosetestFile<CR>
    nnoremap<Leader>nc :NosetestClass<CR>
    nnoremap<Leader>nm :NosetestMethod<CR>
    nnoremap<Leader>nb :NosetestBaseMethod<CR>
    nnoremap<Leader>rr :RerunLastTests<CR>

Your tests results will be available in the quickfix window after they finish
running and you return to your Vim buffer. Open quickfix with `:copen` and
you can jump to failing tests by placing your cursor on the desired test and
pressing enter.

===============================================================================
4. Config File                                        *test-runner-config-file*

To make use of the plugin for Django projects you will need to create a small
config file named ``.vim-django`` in the root of your project that defines some
information about the apps you would like to run tests for. Assuming a basic
folder structure the config file would be saved in the following location.
```
── Project Root
   ├── .vim-django
   ├── manage.py
   ├── app1
   │   └── tests
   │       └── testsa1.py
   └── app2
       └── tests
           ├── testsb1.py
           └── testsb2.py
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 Config file contents                                  *config-file-contents*

4.1.1                                                          *required-fields*

The only required field is a list of the app names that you will be running
tests for.
`"app_name": "app1, app2"`

4.1.2                                                          *optional-fields*

Optional fields that can be set in the vim-django config file are as follows:
- `environment`: If you have modifyed your manage.py file to accept an 
               environment argument then you may use the environment flag to 
               specify which one to run tests for. Example `"environment": "dev"`
               If you haven't modifyed your manage.py file then you don't need to
               use this.

- `flags`:       An array of flags that you would like passed to the test runner
               See example config file below for usage.

4.1.3                                           *vim-django-config-file-example*

Using the example project above we would set the app name to "app1, app2"
The environment field is optional.  We are also saying that we want the test to use
the fail fast option.

```
{"app_name": "app1, app2",
 "environment": "OptionalNameOfEnv",
 "flags": ["failfast"]}
```
*NOTE* be sure to use double quotes in the config file as it is parsed as json

4.1.4                           *vim-django-namespace-package-config-file-example*

Namespace packages are supported, but require slightly different placement of
the `.vim-django` config file. Rather than placing it in the project root place
it in the lowest level package. For example, given a namespace package called
`organization.department.team` the `.vim-django` file would be inside of the
`team` directory.
```
── Project Root
   ├── manage.py
   └── organization
       └── department
           └── team
               └── .vim-django
               └── testsa1.py
               └── tests
                   ├── testsb1.py
                   └── testsb2.py
```

The `.vim-django` file will contain only the top level package name, in this case
`organization`, for example:

```
{"app_name": "organization"}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2 Outside of Django                           *plugin-usage-outside-of-django*

Nothing other than nose is required to use this plugin for tests that are
outside of a Django application.
